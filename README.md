# Homework 0

Due Aug 22

Welcome to COSCS594. In this class, we will be using a variety of
tools that will require some initial configuration. To ensure
everything goes smoothly moving forward, we will setup the majority
of those tools in this homework. Some of this will likely be
tedious, but doing it now will help be more productive in the
exciting work during the rest of the course.  This homework will not be
graded, however it is essential that you complete it timely since it
will enable us to set up your accounts.
